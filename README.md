# Welcome to the ATF project!

The Automated Testing Framework (ATF) is a collection of libraries to
implement test programs in a variety of languages.
At the moment, ATF offers **C, C++ and POSIX** shell bindings with which to implement tests.
These bindings all offer a similar set of functionality and any test
program written with them exposes a consistent user interface.

**ATF-based test programs rely on a separate runtime engine to execute them.**
The runtime engine is in charge of isolating the test programs from the
rest of the system to ensure that their results are deterministic and that
they cannot affect the running system. The runtime engine is also
responsible for gathering the results of all tests and composing reports.
The current runtime of choice is Kyua.

The ATF libraries offer a **simple API**. The API is expressed with the aforementioned
interfaces, allowing developers to quickly write test programs in C, C++, and POSIX shell.

ATF-based test programs offer a **consistent end-user command-line
interface** to allow both humans and automation to run the tests.

ATF-based test programs **rely on an execution engine** to be run and
this execution engine is _not_ shipped with ATF.
**[Kyua](https://github.com/jmmv/kyua/) is the engine of choice.**
